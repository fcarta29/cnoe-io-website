# Compute Platform

<p>This is the platform runtime. It can also be thought of as a deployment target for the applications that make up the platform.
It offers some formalized patterns for interoperability between platform capabilities.</p>
<p>Can offer similar discoverability and uniformity as that of service oriented architectures (SOA)
Can also offer a common medium for data exchange between services like an enterprise service bus or (ESB)</p>
<p>Frequently Kubernetes is the compute and also the substrate for the foundation of platform capabilities.</p>
