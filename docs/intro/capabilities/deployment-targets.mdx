# Deployment Targets

These are the runtime environments that product apps and services run on. This includes static content or data published for distribution.
- Often abstractions hiding the details of underlying environments from the product developers.
  - Regions or localities are a good example of what one might want to mask.
- Common deployment targets include:
  - Kubernetes
  - Lambda
  - Virtual Machines
  - Elastic Container Service
  - Static Content
